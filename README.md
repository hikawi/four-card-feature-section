## My process

### Built with

- [Astro](https://astro.build/), first time.
- [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/).

### What I learned

- CSS grids and placements.
- Astro, wasn't that much but it's a very funny tool.

### Continued development

- Grid was very intuitive to use, would want to have more chances to utilitize it.

### Useful resources

- [Grid Layout](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_grid_layout/Basic_concepts_of_grid_layout) - Using grids to put the cards in their correct places.
